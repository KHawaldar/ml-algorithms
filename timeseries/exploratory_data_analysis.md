# Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
  This is a crucial step in data analysis process to 
  
## Uncover
 - Pattern
 - Anomalies
 - Missing values
## Test
  - Hypothesis
## Verify
  - Assumption
  
By leveraging EDA, data scientists can gain a deeper understanding of the data, 
ensuring more informed and accurate analysis and decision-making.
## How to use EDA Effectively:
1. ### Understand the Data Structure:
   - Statistical inference: Utilize the pandas describe() function to obtain an overview of the dataset, 
   including metrics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
   - Data Type Verification: Ensure consistency in data types, particularly in date formats, to adhere to standard conventions.
2. ### Data Cleansing:
   - Impute the missing value
   - Modify the invalid data
3. ### Visualize Data Distributions:
   - Histograms: Plot histograms to see the distribution of numerical variables.
   - Box Plots: Use box plots to identify outliers and understand the spread of the data.
4. ### Examine Relationships:
   - Correlation Matrix: Calculate and visualize correlations between numerical variables to identify potential relationships.
   - Scatter Plots: Use scatter plots to explore relationships between two continuous variables.
   - Bar Charts: Utilize bar charts to compare categorical data.
5. ### Detect Outliers and Anomalies:
   - Box Plots and Scatter Plots
   - Z scores
6. ### Identify Patterns and Trends: 
   - Time Series Analysis: If the dataset contains time elements, analyze trends and seasonal patterns.
   - Heatmaps: Use Heatmaps to visualize complext relationships in large dataset.
